# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) in Python 3 and Rust.

## Scripts

To auto-download your input of a given day, add these variables to a `.env` file:

```env
AOC_SESSION=<session_cookie>
AOC_YEAR=2020
```

Then run (for day `1`):

```console
$ sh aoci.sh 1
Loading .env
Retrieving input of Advent of Code 2020, day 1
Requesting https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1/input
Writing input to 'input/day01.txt'
COMPLETED
```

This will write your input to a file named `input/day01.txt`.
